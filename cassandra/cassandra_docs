Data modelling :
Data modeling in Cassandra uses a query-driven approach, in which specific queries are the key to organizing the data
in simple words we have to create tables in such a way that the query we are interested in gets processed quickly and efficiently
Cassandra's database design is based on the requirement for fast reads and writes, so the better the schema design, the faster data is written and retrieved.

Comparing with traditional approach :
In contrast, relational databases normalize data based on the tables and relationships designed, and then writes the queries that will be made. Data modeling in relational databases is table-driven, and any relationships between tables are expressed as table joins in queries.

Main point :
the first component of a table's primary key is the partition key; within a partition, rows are clustered by the remaining columns of the key.
Other columns can be indexed separately from the primary key. Because Cassandra is a distributed database, efficiency is gained for reads and
writes when data is grouped together on nodes by partition. The fewer partitions that must be queried to get an answer to a question, the faster
the response.

In simple words :
As cassandra is distributed db it stores partitions on different nodes , this partition is decided by partition key which is the first part of
primary key , the query processing will be faster if we query less number of partition. So partition key should be decided strategically
Remaining cols in primary key uniquely identifies a row in the partition
We normally cannot query on columns which are not part of primary key , but we can create index for them separately.Though it wont be very efficient.
It is better to create table wrt your query. As storing data is cheaper in cassandra.
